# If you have already created SSH keys before or did this thing before, skip to "SSH & FTP Connecting with Existing Keys"
===========================[SSH Key Generation & FTP Connecting 1st time]===========================
00. Video Reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDcjM7BySo0&ab_channel=OnePageZen
00. Download FileZilla & PuTTy (filezilla-project.org & putty.org)
1. Open PuTTy Key Generator (PuTTy will download multiple applications so pic this one specifically.)
2. Generate your PuTTY key (click generate a public/private key pair)
3. Highlight and copy the generated Public Key for OpenSSH, as well as your Key comment. Paste them in a notepad somewhere.
3.5. click Save private key (do not protect with passphrase coz that's wack. It's optional.)
# You definately wanna save this somewhere where it's not gonna move a lot. Saves you a hassle in the future with things like FileZilla.
4. Open Google Cloud -> Compute Engine -> Metadata -> SSH Keys: add your SSH key. (KEY not fingerprint or smthn)
5. Go and copy your VM's External IP Adresss
6. Go to FileZilla(or whatever your ftp thingy is) > Edit > Settings > SFTP > Add your key file that you saved (private key) and click OK
7. In the Host of FileZilla write "sftp://" then paste your VM External IP Adress.
8. For username write you PuTTY "Key Comment" Thingy.
9. Leave Password empty. If the next step doesn't work try entering in the Password section whatever you entered as your passphrase if you did one.
10. Hit Quickconnect and enjoy.

===========================[Permission Denied for Edit and stuff]===========================
#Note: Most following steps require sudo perm. If you are already the sudo user then no need. If you are not, try putting sudo before each of these commands.
-Go to your Ubuntu Home directory (or like the place you see the moment you open your SSH Portal)
-type: stat -c "%a %n" *
-This will show you the levels of permission for each file/folder/directory in that place. you can see the permision level for a specific file by typing it's
	name instead of the *
-If your files are 644 or 755 or smthn less than 777 then FileZila probably cannot acccess it and needs more permission.
-To set a file as 777, enter this command: "chmod 777 *" or "chmod 777 <Filename/Directory>"
#Note: 777 Is the highest level of permission a file can have. Dangerous if you have a project with multiple Admins. If it's only you no problem, but good practice
to nerf the permission level after you are done with your SSH FTP stuff.
